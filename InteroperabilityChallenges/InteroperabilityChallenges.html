		<div>Incomplete PHILack of integration between systems used by different providers means the patient record in one facility may be incomplete. This hinders effective patient care.

</div>
		<div>Security RisksLack of integration between providers exposes patient records to a manual exchange workflow with the risk of security breaches.

</div>
		<div>DelaysLack of integration between providers may mean delays in exchange of patient records, which adversely affect care and increase patient dissatisfaction with service.

</div>
		<div>Secure Exchange of PHI with Non-Acute FacilitiesMany non-Acute and post-Acute providers lack integration with the EHR systems of affiliated hospitals. This is a barrier to digital, secure exchange of PHI when a hospital patient is discharged to a non-Acute provider. This lack is also a barrier when a non-Acute provider must send a patient or resident to the hospital.
</div>
		<div>Mergers and AcquisitionsMergers and acquisitions in healthcare bring together providers that may use different EHR systems. If there are gaps in interoperability, the providers must integrate their systems.

</div>
		<div>Unsecured FaxTo share patient records with network partners, some providers rely mainly on older fax communication. A legacy fax connection only provides a phone number, but not necessarily the identification of the sender or receiver.

</div>
		<div>Higher OverheadAny manual steps that must be performed during the exchange of patient information can lead to higher overhead costs.

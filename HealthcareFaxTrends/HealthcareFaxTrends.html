</div>
		<div>Fax MethodsUse of stand-alone devices is expected to decline. Cloud fax services are expected to grow in volume as organizations phase out stand-alone fax machines.  Fax servers in local networks are not expected to grow as much as cloud fax services.

</div>
		<div>ConsolidationMost organizations are consolidating all faxing into a single solution.

</div>
		<div>IntegrationMost fax users have already integrated or are evaluating integration of fax with their business applications or other technologies. Workflow automation is one of the drivers of this trend.

		<div>Accurate Patient InformationPatients expect hospital staff to be prepared to receive them with accurate information about their admission, testing, diagnosis, and treatment.

</div>
		<div>Timely CommunicationsPatients expect communications in a timely manner about all services they are to receive in the facility.

</div>
		<div>Long Wait TimesLong wait times for patients at admission and at clinical facilities are not satisfactory and need to be decreased.

</div>
		<div>Improving Check-InFacilities need to improve the patient check-in experience through automation and better use of digital technology.

</div>
		<div>Reimbursement
The patient experience can drive reimbursement levels from claims. Reimbursement to hospitals for patient care continues to evolve, and the acute care market is becoming more competitive.

</div>
		<div>Patient Experience ScoresMedicare and Medicaid services tie reimbursement to patient survey scores from the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS). Hospital leaders are looking for ways to improve patient experience and boost their scores from patient surveys done by HCAHPS.

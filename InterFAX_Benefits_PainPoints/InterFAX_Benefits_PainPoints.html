        Traditional fax devices and fax lines - although HIPAA compliant - pose
        serious security risks to healthcare organizations. These  risks include
        unauthorized access to Protected Health Information, or PHI, and
        financial penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA. These risks are
        driving more attention to cloud fax services in all healthcare
        settings. By replacing traditional fax with cloud fax, healthcare
        leaders can mitigate the risks associated with physical fax
        infrastructure.

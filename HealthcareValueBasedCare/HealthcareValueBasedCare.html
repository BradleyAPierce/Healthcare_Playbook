		<div>Coordination of CareLack of resources makes it difficult to coordinate patient care on a large scale across multiple providers.

</div>
		<div>Disparate EHR SystemsIt is difficult to improve the quality of care across multiple disparate EHR systems.

</div>
		<div>Sources of DataSeparate sources of patient data create barriers to managing Value Based Care.

</div>
		<div>Unstructured InformationMuch high–value patient information is in unstructured text and images and therefore difficult to extract and organize on a large scale.

</div>
		<div>Use of DataData must be analyzed and organized to inform better clinical decisions.

</div>
		<div>Complete Patient StoryCompiling a complete patient story means extracting clinical, financial, and economic data from multiple sources and integrating it into one platform.

</div>
		<div>Focus on Care of Patient CohortsWithout robust analytics, it is difficult to focus clinical improvement efforts on subpopulations or cohorts of patients by disease, by condition, or by risk factors

</div>
		<div>Patient “Leakage"Potential revenue and data is lost when patients go out–of–network to other facilities or practices.

</div>
		<div>RegulationsEvolving regulations may be difficult to interpret and implement for compliance.
